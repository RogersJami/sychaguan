			<h3>the news room--HBO</h3>
		下面是其中开始第一集的一段演讲，这段演讲不错: &quot;为什么美国不是世界上最伟大的国家&quot; - 有敢于直言的人的国家, 才不<br />
会衰落.<br />
<br />
And with a straight face, you’re gonna sit there and tell students that <br />
America is so star-spangled awesome that we’re the only ones in the world <br />
who have freedom? Canada has freedom. Japan has freedom. The U.K. France. <br />
Italy. Germany. Spain. Australia. BELGIUM has freedom. (laughs) Two hundred <br />
and seven sovereign states in the world, like, a hundred and eighty of them <br />
have freedom.<br />
<br />
&quot;And you, Sorority Girl, just in case you accidentally wander into a voting <br />
booth one day, there’s some things you should know. One of them is there’s <br />
absolutely no evidence to support the statement that we’re the greatest <br />
country in the world. We’re seventh in literacy. Twenty-seventh in math. <br />
Twenty-second in science. Forty-ninth in life expectancy. A hundred and <br />
seventy-eighth in infant mortality. Third in median household income. Number <br />
four in labor force and number four in exports. We lead the world in only <br />
three categories: Number of incarcerated citizens per capita, number of <br />
adults who believe angels are real, and defense spending, where we spend <br />
more than the next twenty-six countries combined, twenty-five of whom are <br />
allies.<br />
<br />
&quot;Now none of this is the fault of a twenty-year-old college student, but you <br />
nonetheless are without a doubt a member of the worst, period, generation, <br />
period, ever, period. So when you ask what makes us the greatest country in <br />
the world, I dunno what the fuck you’re talkin’ about. Yosemite?<br />
<br />
&quot;Sure used to be. We stood up for what was right. We fought for moral <br />
reasons. We passed laws, struck down laws, for moral reasons. We waged wars <br />
on poverty, not poor people. We sacrificed. We cared about our neighbors. We <br />
put our money where our mouths were. And we never beat our chest.<br />
<br />
&quot;We built great big things, made ungodly technological advances, explored <br />
the universe, cured diseases, and we cultivated the world’s greatest <br />
artists and the world’s greatest economy.  We reached for the stars. <br />
Acted like men.<br />
<br />
&quot;We aspired to intelligence. We didn’t belittle it—it didn’t make us feel <br />
inferior.<br />
<br />
&quot;We didn’t identify ourselves by who we voted for in the last election, and <br />
we didn’t, oh, we didn’t scare so easy. Ha. We were able to be all these <br />
things and do all these things because we were informed. By great men. Men <br />
who were revered. First step in solving any problem is recognizing there is <br />
one. America is not the greatest country in the world anymore.  <br />
Enough? &quot;<br />
而且这个剧的信息量特别的大，尤其是第三集我看了三遍，然后查了很多的资料才搞明白。 <br />
三权分立必需加上第四权媒体的监督才能良好的运行下去。<br />
看着国内的媒体一步一步的娱乐话，低俗话，不知道什么时候才能拨乱反正，恢复到一个大国应有的风范，或者说能够代表社会良知，引领社会进步。<br />
