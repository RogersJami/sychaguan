NASA也就是个组织者吧，换成私营公司也没啥，只要有大批技术过硬的承包商<br />
呵呵，我上周听新闻的时候和同事说：<br />
<br />
SpaceX和波音或者其它军火承包商这几十年来做的有什么区别？除了波音是把火箭卖给NASA，而SpaceX用自己的名字？				<p class="author">

就算NASA把图纸都给他们，这家伙自己组织千来号人把事情干成，还是很让人敬佩的。<br />
<br />
这说明美国私企的运作水平和效率比国内私企高的多！				<p class="author">

		呵呵,看最近国内某些JY激动啊,就差没跪地山呼私人资本万岁了.<br />
他们玩来玩去就一招——选择性无视，<br />
在欢呼私人也能射火箭之时，JY就故意遗忘了，NASA每年消耗N百亿的预算，居然现在需要付钱给私人来发火箭了，<br />
这要在国内，JY一定要高喊，解散NASA！				<p class="author">

<br />
嘿嘿,<br />
这些JY不会说,<br />
NASA这个号称精英云集,代表美国高科技精化中的精化的机构,<br />
吃美国的,用美国的,每年消耗无数美金之后,<br />
竟然要受老毛子讹诈,付高额出场费给毛子飞船,不然美国宇航员就上不了太空了.<br />
<br />
JY 也不会说,<br />
NASA出资赞助这个所谓的SPACE X公司,原因之一竟是受不了毛子经常性、狮子大开口式的提价.<br />
<br />
JY更不会说，<br />
SPACE X不就是原先NASA精英换件马甲，用国家资源研究得到经验后，蒙声不响，<br />
自己转头“下海创业”，再回过来继续大敲NASA一笔，还美其名曰，私人资本的创新性。<br />
<br />
<br />
我敢打赌，SPACE X这事，只要发生地点换到国内，JY们声讨的口水都能淹没北京城，<br />
我上面说得那些，全会被JY演绎成十恶不赦的大罪。<br />

		SPACE X不满足于NASA的扛包活，惦记着米军的发射任务了，问题是美国发射联盟他们让他掺和吗？<br />
路透：“龙飞船”成功可能为SpaceX带来军事订单<br />

SpaceX flight opens door for U.S. military payloads<br />
<br />
Tue Jun 5, 2012 3:14pm EDT<br />
* 3rd flight of Falcon 9 rocket builds case for reliability<br />
<br />
* Boeing-Lockheed partnership has monopoly on some launches<br />
<br />
* U.S. military wants competition, more launch providers<br />
<br />
By Irene Klotz<br />
<br />
CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla., June 5 (Reuters) - Space Exploration Technologies' unmanned Dragon capsule arrived in Los Angeles on Tuesday following a test flight for NASA that could open the door to a long-desired and more elusive customer - the U.S. military.<br />
<br />
The cargo capsule blasted off May on 22 from Cape Canaveral Air Force Base in Florida and three days later became the first privately owned spaceship to reach the International Space Station, a $100 billion project of 15 nations that flies some 240 miles (390 km) above Earth.<br />
<br />
Dragon splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on May 31 and was returned by barge to the Port of Los Angeles before dawn on Tuesday.<br />
<br />
The successful test flight not only means Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, can start working off a $1.6 billion contract with NASA to fly cargo to the space station. It also clears a key hurdle for SpaceX to compete for Department of Defense business as well, which would mean launching military satellites.<br />
<br />
Dragon's launch was the third successive flight of SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket, which debuted in June 2010.<br />
<br />
Flying three times successfully was among the criteria the company needed to meet to become eligible to compete for military business under a new program designed to draw competition into a field now monopolized by United Launch Alliance, a partnership of Boeing and Lockheed Martin .<br />
<br />
“&quot;The new entrant criteria did say three launches are required (for Falcon 9) before certification can happen for national security payloads,&quot; said SpaceX Communications Director Kirstin Brost Grantham.<br />
<br />
There are several paths toward certification, and the requirements can vary, Air Force spokeswoman Tracy Bunko said.<br />
<br />
&quot;“If the new entrant has a launch vehicle with a more robust, demonstrated successful flight history, then we may require less technical evaluation for certification. But, it also depends on the risk assessment of the mission,&quot; Bunko wrote in an email to Reuters.<br />
<br />
Near term, United Launch Alliance, or ULA, will remain the sole provider of heavy- and medium-lift commercial launch services to the U.S. military with its Delta 4 and Atlas 5 rockets.<br />
<br />
But the wall is cracking. The Air Force is expected to award a non-ULA launch services contract this year for the Deep Space Climate Observatory, a NASA Earth-monitoring satellite that is being repurposed by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) into a solar observatory. The Air Force issued a request for bids on May 11.<br />
<br />
A second satellite, the Air Force's Space Test Payload-2, also has been set aside for a new launch services provider.<br />
<br />
ELUSIVE MARKET<br />
<br />
In addition to 12 cargo-delivery flights for NASA, SpaceX has booked Falcon rocket flights for more than 28 other launches for a variety of companies, foreign governments and other customers.<br />
<br />
“&quot;The one market that we have not yet been successful with is launching Defense Department satellites, although we're hopeful that we'll win one or two demonstration launches this year,&quot; Musk said after Dragon's return from orbit.<br />
<br />
“&quot;Hopefully the successive flights of Falcon 9 in a row will give them the confidence they need to open up the defense contract for competition,&quot; he said.<br />
<br />
Robert Bigelow, the president of privately owned Bigelow Aerospace, said the Falcon 9 would create a paradigm shift within the global launch industry.<br />
<br />
&quot;The Falcon 9 has clearly arrived and proven itself as a reliable and affordable launch system for NASA, the Air Force and commercial payloads,&quot; said Bigelow.<br />
<br />
His company plans to build, fly and operate commercial space stations and habitats in orbit, and has a marketing agreement with SpaceX for flight services.<br />
<br />
Last week, SpaceX added Intelsat as the first customer for its planned Falcon Heavy rocket, which is expected to have twice the lift capacity of ULA's Delta 4 Heavy, currently the biggest booster in the U.S. fleet.<br />
<br />
A Falcon Heavy mission costs between $83 million and $128 million, according to SpaceX's website, a fraction of a Delta 4 Heavy rocket launch.<br />
<br />
For now, ULA isn't worried.<br />
<br />
“&quot;In order for a fair competition, a new entrant would need to support the full set of mission and technical requirements. In addition, entrants also will be faced with stringent government oversight, accounting and reporting requirements - none of which is part of a commercial business plan,&quot; ULA spokeswoman Jessica Rye wrote in an email to Reuters.<br />
<br />
&quot;ULA also understands that the issue is not about competition, but how can our customers enable the reliable delivery of important space capabilities that protect our nation and promote science at the most cost-efficient method,&quot; she added.				<p class="author">

呵呵，这个差距还不小。牟老板还是停留在商业的空手套白狼阶段，干实体好像欠火候。看看冯仑的书有提到过				<p class="author">
