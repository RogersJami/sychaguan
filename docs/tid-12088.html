I heard the sound of their shoes treading the hallway fast. And soon the sound faded away.我听得到他们的脚步声，急促地穿过走廊。这声音很快远去，直到消失。Shocked, I froze in my place for a few seconds, we were still alive, that was good enough for me to think of right now. Sally and Majd were still hugging my legs so tight. I turned around and knelt on my knees trying to see their faces, which were yellow with fear but still the most beautiful thing I could ever lay my eyes on. I adore those tiny creatures more than my heart can bear. I hugged them tight and their breath calmed down along with the beating of my throbbing heart.我惊吓的厉害，呆呆地站在那里有一会儿。我们还活着，在那一刻，这算是我能够考虑到的最好的事。萨丽和马吉德，还紧紧地抱着我的腿。我扭过身子，弯下膝盖，搞得很费力，看看他们的小脸。他们都吓得脸色蜡黄，就算是这样，他们还是我眼里最美丽的事物。我实在是太爱这两个小生命了，爱到超越了我的心所能承受。我又紧紧抱住他们，我的心狂跳，孩子们的呼吸却渐渐平静了。Oh God I missed my mother. She passed away a few months ago for a heart attack. Only when I became a mother I realized how great her love was for me, my only sister Leila and my two brothers, Yasser and Bilal. She was not just a mother. She was a well-known Arabic teacher in our town for her great methods that she used in teaching. Her students absolutely adored her. She was the glue that held the family all together. Such a great loving, caring, devoted mother, teacher, neighbor and simply just great at everything! I always kept her so close in my heart and would always feel so blessed that I had her as my mother. But…I missed her. Sometimes I missed her too much that tears would run down my cheeks in silence whenever I recalled her warm comforting smile, her sweet jasmine perfume, her voice, her scolding of me when I did something wrong as a kid. I missed her. If only she could be there for me now, telling me that all would be just fine.哦，上帝，那一刻我想到了妈妈。几个月以前，她因为心脏病远离我们而去。她对我们的爱，我做了母亲以后才有切身体会，那是多么的伟大。她把爱都给了我、我唯一的姐姐莱拉，还有两个兄弟亚塞尔和比拉尔。她不仅仅是一位母亲，她还是我们镇上出名的阿拉伯语老师，她有一套很出色的教学方法。她受到学生的深深爱戴。她把这个家凝聚在一起。她的爱好伟大，她把自己奉献给了我们，她那么有同情心，她是个好老师、好邻居，她做什么都比别人出色！妈妈总是放在我的心坎上，一直觉得好幸运，我有这样的妈妈。唉，我就是想她。有时候我想她想的太厉害，不管什么时候我一想到她温暖慈祥的笑容，眼泪就止不住地流。她的音容笑貌，香甜如茉莉花的芬芳。我孩提时代犯错时，她的责骂，好像还在耳边。我想念妈妈。但愿她这会儿就在我身旁，告诉我所有的一切都会好起来。But wait …no ..No matter how odd that might sound. I was relieved that she passed away in peace. I would have been extremely disturbed and worried if I knew that my mother was going through the hell I was going through then. At least she died in peace, knowing that her kids were safe and sound and happy with their families.话说回来，不管，不管听起来多么奇怪，我还是感到宽慰，妈妈毕竟是是在和平时期辞世的。如果让妈妈和我们一道经历这地狱般的生活，我不知道要多忧心多难受。至少，她死于和平生活，那时她的孩子们都平安，都和家人快乐幸福滴生活着。At such times, times of war and brutal violence, it was okay to get hurt or even died if you could only assure that your loved ones are safe. And there she was, my mother, safe in heavens and smiling down at me, telling me in a way or another that all would be fine somehow.着这样的时候，战争和野蛮尘嚣直上的时候，你仅仅确信自己最爱的人平安，就算自己受伤害或者死去都值了。她就在那里，我的妈妈，平平安安地在天堂里，微笑着俯瞰着我，用这种或者那种方式对我说，一切都会变好，以一种我还不了解的方式。I picked up my kids, and trod out of my room as silently as I could. Then I called for Susan,“ Susan, are you okay? Are you all okay”“ yes, Rana, we are fine, what about your and the kids?” Susan’s answered me in whispers of fear and tiredness.“ we are all okay. Have you seen Salem or your husband, Fadi, yet?” I asked worried.“ no. I asked the soldiers about our husbands but they would not answer me. Good heavens, I hope nothing bad has happened to them” She answered.我抱起孩子们，尽力保持无声，把脚探出门，试着小声呼喊苏珊，“苏珊，你好吗？你们都好吗？”“是的我们都好，你和孩子咋样？”苏珊由于惊吓和疲惫，回答的声音软软地。“我们都好。看到萨勒姆和你丈夫法迪没？”我焦急地问。“没。我问了那些士兵，他们不说。天哪，他们别出啥事吧。”她回答。Her words only got me more worried. But I dared not to go outside. My kids were stuck to me like a second skin and I would not risk having them in danger.“ God, please please please Save Salem and Fadi” I repeated over and over in my heart. And then sat on the floor and wept my heart out. I did not want to be left alone in this madness.她的话只是让我更忧虑。可我又不敢踏出门。孩子们缠在我身上，像是长了第二层皮，厚厚的一层重压在身上，难以迈步。我也不想带着他们冒险。我心里一遍一遍喊着，“上帝，求你求你求你救助塞勒姆和法迪。”我无力地坐到地上，腾出一只手抚摸心口。我不想一个人留在这狂乱的人世上。Salem was a really good husband. He adored his kids and did all he could to afford us everything we wanted. We had our fights and disagreements, but at such times, all I had in mind was his good traits. I knew I could do the impossible to protect my kids, but in fact there was nothing I could do. It was too insane outside to do anything. Having Salem with me and my kids was a must!萨勒姆是个好丈夫。他深爱孩子，我们想要的任何东西，他都竭力想法供应。我和他打过架吵过嘴，但在现在这种时候，我想到的都是他的好处。为了保护孩子，我想我可以做任何不可能的事情，实际上我啥也做不了。这种极端时候，女人出去做任何事都是非常愚蠢的。萨勒姆和我们在一起，那是必须的！“ God, please please please Save Salem and Fadi” was the prayer I kept repeating with the tears and the pain.我一边流泪一边心痛，一遍一遍祈祷，“上帝，求你求你求你救救萨勒姆和法迪！”“ Rana, Susan…Are you okay? Are you all okay?” Fadi’s voice came from the yard outside, whispering loudly but firm and fine.“拉娜，苏珊......你们好吗？你们都好吗？”法迪的声音，从院子外传来，声音压得低低的，听上去又坚定又完好。Finally, a sigh of relief and a smile of unmatched happiness were all I could do.最终，我能做的就是放松和微笑，那是无法察觉的幸福感觉。“ Yes we are. We are all fine. Are you all okay out there?” Susan asked worriedly.“是的我们还好。我们都好。你们都好吗？”“ yes we are, do not worry. The soldiers are all gone now. We will be inside in a few minutes. We are just checking on a few neighbors. We have heard that we could leave to the capital early in the morning tomorrow. Pray for us.” Fadi’s cheering voice answered.“我们都好，别担心。士兵都走了。过一小会儿，我们就进屋。我们和几个邻居查看查看周围。听说，明天早晨我们就可以离开这里，去大马士革。为我们祈祷吧。”法迪开心的地说着。<br />

这是最近的谈话吗，叙利亚政府最近情势有所缓解，ISIS的压力都跑到北部库尔德人那边去了<br />
<br />
上个星期的对话。<br />
<br />
大马士革周围，JOBAR区，10月份叙利亚政府军刚刚发起一场战役，夺回了大部分；东古塔区，基本都在基地、IS和自由军手里；西古塔也在基地组织手里；与黎巴嫩相连的派拉蒙山区，反对派不断渗透骚扰。<br />
<br />
南部德拉省，美国训练的自由军最近发起进攻，攻下了一个战略重镇。<br />
<br />
中部霍姆斯省，政府军一直在与IS争夺油气田。哈马省，在不断战斗，拉锯战。<br />
<br />
北部伊德利卜省，拉锯战。<br />
<br />
北部阿勒颇省，战役还没结束。<br />
<br />
中东部拜耳祖尔，与IS争夺重要战略资源地。<br />
<br />
还有几处，我不大了解。				<p class="author">

德拉是约旦过来的自由军和基地组织，不是IS			<div class="page">
